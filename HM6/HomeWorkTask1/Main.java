//Task description
//        Create Payment interface with the method calculatePay(), the base class Employee with a string variable employeeId.
//        Create two classes SalariedEmployee and ContractEmployee, which implement interface and are inherited from the base class.
//        Describe hourly paid workers in the relevant classes (one of the children), and fixed paid workers (second child).
//        Describe the string variable socialSecurityNumber in the class SalariedEmployee .
//        Include a description of federalTaxIdMember in the class of ContractEmployee.
//        The calculation formula for the "time-workerâ€œ is: the average monthly salary = hourly rate * number of hours worked
//        For employees with a fixed payment the formula is: the average monthly 	salary = fixed monthly payment
//        Create an array of employees and add the employees with different form of payment.
//        Arrange the entire sequence of workers descending the average monthly wage.
//        Output the employee ID, name, and the average monthly wage for all elements of the list.
