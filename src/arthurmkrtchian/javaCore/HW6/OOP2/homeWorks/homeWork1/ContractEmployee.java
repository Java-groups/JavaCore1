//        Create Payment interface with the method calculatePay(), the base class Employee
//        with a string variable employeeld. Create two classes SalariedEmployee and
//        ContractEmployee, which implement interface and are inherited from the base class.
//        Describe hourly paid workers in the relevant classes (one of the children),
//        and fixed paid workers (second child).
//        Describe the string variable socialSecurityNumber in the class SalariedEmployee .
//        Include a description of federalTaxIdmember in the class of ContractEmployee.
//        The calculation formula for the "time-workerâ€œ is: the average monthly
//        salary = hourly rate * number of hours worked
//        For employees with a fixed payment the formula is: the average monthly salary = fixed monthly payment
//        Create an array of employees and add the employees with different form of payment.
//        Arrange the entire sequence of workers descending the average monthly wage.
//        Output the employee ID, name, and the average monthly wage for all elements of the list.
