List accolades turned up in bunches. Ms. Javice appeared on the 2019 Forbes 30 Under 30 finance list.
Then she made the Crain’s New York Business 40 Under 40 list. “Javice has done her homework,” the Crain’s article said.

Not everyone agreed. The next year, Wesley Whistle, who worked at the New America think tank at the time,
wrote a blog post calling out Frank and Ms. Javice for promising help with pandemic relief for students,
even though Frank wasn’t working with schools directly and the company’s tool might not have been of any use to many students.

Not long after that, the Federal Trade Commission sent a warning letter to Frank noting that its
“purported assistance to students consists primarily of providing a form letter that may lack the
information a student would need to apply for one of the grants from his or her school.”

The agency also wasn’t fond of Frank’s offer at the time to give students cash advances on their financial aid,
“with no interest, no fees — ever.” The company’s terms “appear to require the advance to be paid back within 61 days,
whether or not the student has received any aid from his or her college or university by that time,” the agency said.
“Additionally, Frank charges a $19.90 monthly fee.”

Frank tried other ways of making money. It offered to help people appeal their financial aid offers
“for a $144.95 one-time commitment.”

The company also made a big push to add online courses to its offerings.
That was a key element of a November 2019 investor presentation, stamped “Draft & Confidential,
” a copy of which was reviewed by The Times. “Students spend $400 billion on tuition,
var
and ethically serving this market gives us access to extraordinary opportunity,” the presentation said.
