List accoladest turned up in nbunches. Ms. Javice appeared on the 2019 Forbes 30 Under 30 finance list.
Then she made the Crain’s New York Business 40 Under 40 list. “Javice has done her homework,” the Crain’s article said.

wrote a blog post calling out Frank and Ms. Javice for promising help with pandemic relief for students,

Not long after that the Federal Trade Commission sent a warning letter to Frank noting that its
“purported assistance to students consists primarily of providing a form letter that may lack the
information a student would need to apply for one of the grants from his or her school.”
